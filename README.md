## Usage

The usage is very straight forward, say you want to use the `makeCircle()` function in the `ZB-UIViewExtension.swift` file
  1) Download Repo
  2) Add the file to your project
  3) Make this call wherever needed: `myView.makeCircle()`

Its a pretty simple to use, just look over and use which ever files you deem necessary.
